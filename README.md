# ADB ANDROID MALWARE POC FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ONLY DO NOT USE THIS TO INFECT DEVICES THAT IS A CRIME!

The script connects to Android devices using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) through the Shodan API, which searches for devices with open ADB ports. It starts by importing necessary libraries and initializing the Shodan API with a key. The user is prompted to enter a command payload to execute on the devices. The adb_connection function establishes a TCP connection to the specified device, executes the given command, and retrieves output such as SSH credentials and the device's IMEI number. It also attempts to dump the kernel log, which can contain sensitive information. Any found SSH credentials are saved to a file. The main function, search_and_execute, searches for devices with open ADB ports and creates a new thread for each connection, allowing multiple devices to be processed simultaneously. It handles exceptions to ensure that errors are reported without crashing the script.If you want to specify versions, you can run pip freeze after installing the packages to see the versions currently in your environment, and then adjust the file accordingly. Hereâ€™s a command to create the requirements.txt directly from your current environment by typing pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Android Malware Script
